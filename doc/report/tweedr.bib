	abstract = {A class-imbalanced classifier is a decision rule to predict the class membership of new samples from an available data set where the class sizes differ considerably. When the class sizes are very different, most standard classification algorithms may favor the larger (majority) class resulting in poor accuracy in the minority class prediction. A class-imbalanced classifier typically modifies a standard classifier by a correction strategy or by incorporating a new strategy in the training phase to account for differential class sizes. This article reviews and evaluates some most important methods for class prediction of high-dimensional imbalanced data. The evaluation addresses the fundamental issues of the class-imbalanced classification problem: imbalance ratio, small disjuncts and overlap complexity, lack of data and feature selection. Four class-imbalanced classifiers are considered. The four classifiers include three standard classification algorithms each coupled with an ensemble correction strategy and one support vector machines ({SVM)-based} correction classifier. The three algorithms are (i) diagonal linear discriminant analysis ({DLDA)}, (ii) random forests ({RFs)} and (ii) {SVMs.} The {SVM-based} correction classifier is {SVM} threshold adjustment ({SVM-THR).} A {Monte–Carlo} simulation and five genomic data sets were used to illustrate the analysis and address the issues. The {SVM-ensemble} classifier appears to perform the best when the class imbalance is not too severe. The {SVM-THR} performs well if the imbalance is severe and predictors are highly correlated. The {DLDA} with a feature selection can perform well without using the ensemble correction.},

  abstract = {We examine the response to the recent natural disaster Hurricane Irene on Twitter.com. We collect over 65,000 Twitter messages relating to Hurricane Irene from August 18th to August 31st, 2011, and group them by location and gender. We train a sentiment classifier to categorize messages based on level of concern, and then use this classifier to investigate demographic differences. We report three principal findings: (1) the number of Twitter messages related to Hurricane Irene in directly affected regions peaks around the time the hurricane hits that region; (2) the level of concern in the days leading up to the hurricane's arrival is dependent on region; and (3) the level of concern is dependent on gender, with females being more likely to express concern than males. Qualitative linguistic variations further support these differences. We conclude that social media analysis provides a viable, real-time complement to traditional survey methods for understanding public perception towards an impending disaster.},

	abstract = {During times of disasters online users generate a significant amount of data, some of which are extremely valuable for relief efforts. In this paper, we study the nature of social-media content generated during two different natural disasters. We also train a model based on conditional random fields to extract valuable information from such content. We evaluate our techniques over our two datasets through a set of carefully designed experiments. We also test our methods over a non-disaster dataset to show that our extraction model is useful for extracting information from socially-generated content in general.},
