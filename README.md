## Project goal

Disasters are hard to prepare for, so relief efforts must process large amounts
of information in a short amount of time.

This project aims to develop natural language processing tools to make it
easier for disaster volunteers to know what's damaged where and when,
who needs what, etc., in order to expedite on-site efforts.
